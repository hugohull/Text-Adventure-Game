# Text-Adventure-Game

This project was developed as part of a coursework assignment for a C++ module at the University of Leicester, with the goal of creating a basic text-based adventure game.

## Instructions

1. Download the repository code.
2. In Terminal, navigate to the project folder and run the command:
   ```bash
   ./main resources/[map.json]
Replace [map.json] with the desired map file (e.g., map1.json).

## Game Commands

Once the game starts, use the following commands to interact with the game environment:

	•	look or look around: Displays information about the current room.
	•	go x: Moves in the specified direction to an exit within the room (e.g., go east, go left).
	•	take x: Picks up an item within the room (e.g., take gun).
	•	kill x: Attacks an enemy within the room (e.g., kill zombie).

## Game Objectives

Each map has a hidden goal, defined in the map data file but not revealed to the player. Objectives may include:

	•	Defeating a specific set of enemies.
	•	Collecting certain objects.
	•	Reaching a designated room.
